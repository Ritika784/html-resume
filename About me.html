I am a recent high school graduate, looking for a position which will allow me to gain new knowledge and experience.
For the past 10 years I resided in Toronto, Canada. My level of English is proficient. I understand the structure of the language and can express this understanding to other people. I am also able to use idiomatic expressions and understand local accents. Russian is my native language, which I practice on a daily basis.
While studying in Canada, I participated in various group projects, volunteer programs and worked summer jobs, where I gained experience in working with diverse communities.
My immediate goal is to decide on which career path to pursue, including post secondary education. I am motivated to gain new knowledge and experience while working on new projects.
My interests include psychology and communication, and my hobbies include sketching and playing video games. I am very comfortable completing various tasks on PC, both Windows and Mac operating systems, which is certainly a useful skill to have.
